# Install & Configure Docker


If an older version of docker is installed remove it with the following command:

As the root user (or sudo), run the following:
```
apt remove docker*
```
Install Docker
```
curl https://releases.rancher.com/install-docker/20.10.sh | sh
```
Create a Docker volume
```
docker volume create broadcaster-lpData
```
Create keystore directory
```
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker/volumes/broadcaster-lpData/_data/arbitrum-one-mainnet/keystore/
```
Create eth-secret file
```
nano -p /var/lib/docker/volumes/broadcaster-lpData/_data/eth-secret.txt
```

Enter a strong password to secure your Ethereum account and save the file.  This password is used to decrypt the keystore file and access the private key. **Make sure to never share or lose access to either the password or the keystore file.**

Create Docker Compose file
```
nano docker-compose.yml
```
Copy and paste the following and save the following
```
version: '3.9'

services:
  broadcaster:
    image: livepeer/go-livepeer:<RELEASE_VERSION>
    container_name: "broadcaster"
    hostname: "broadcaster"
    ports:

      - 8935:8935
    volumes:
      - broadcaster-lpData:/root/.lpData

    external: true
```

# Start Livepeer Broadcaster
In this step we need to strat the Broadcaster in the foreground to create an Ethereum account for the Broadcaster.
```
docker compose run -it broadcaster
```
When prompted enter the password you created for the eth-secret.txt file

After you see the message that the Ethereum account has been unlocked, quit Livepeer.



# Modify Docker compose file to include eth-secret
```
nano docker-compose.yml
```
Add the following command to the file and save
```
-ethPassword=/root/.lpData/eth-secret.txt
```
Start Livepeer in the background
```
docker compose up -d
```
Launch the livepeer_cli
```
docker exec -it broadcaster /bin/bash
livepeer_cli -host broadcaster
```

Jump to [Configure the Livepeer Broadcaster](/broadcasters/guides/configure-broadcaster) to finish configuring the Broadcaster
