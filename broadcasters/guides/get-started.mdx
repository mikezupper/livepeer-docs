PUT B STUFF HERE

## Prerequisites

- How to work with a command-line interface
  - `wget` is recommended (alternatively, `cURL` can be used)
  - [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#grpcurl) for interacting
    with gRPC servers for testing and monitoring
- Basic familiarity with installing binaries directly or with Docker
- Familiarity with networking concepts and configuration (URLs, ports and port
  forwarding, static IPs, etc)
- Access to a
  [hosted or self-hosted Arbitrum node](/orchestrators/guides/connect-to-arbitrum)
- Decent bandwidth. Low bandwidth will result in poor performance on the network

## Run the Go Livepeer client in broadcaster mode.


### Run the `livepeer` command

You're now ready to run `Go Livepeer` in broadcaster mode.

```bash
livepeer \
    -network arbitrum-one-mainnet \
    -ethUrl <ETH_URL> \
    -ethAcctAddr <ETH_ACCT_ADDR> \ # Only required if you already have an ETH account you want to use
    -orchestrator \
    -transcoder \
    -nvidia <NVIDIA_DEVICE_IDs> \ # Only required for transcoding with Nvidia GPUs
    -pricePerUnit <PRICE_PER_UNIT> \
    -serviceAddr <SERVICE_ADDR> # Hostname/IP:port
```

#### Flags

- Use the `-ethUrl` flag to
  [connect to the arbitrum network](/orchestrators/guides/connect-to-arbitrum)
  using a hosted or self hosted Arbitrum node.

- Use the `-ethAcctAddr` flag to specify the ETH account address that you want
  the node to use.

> **Note:** This flag is only required if you already have an account that you
> want to use.

- Be sure the private key for the account address is stored in the keystore
  directory.

> This defaults to `~/.lpData/arbitrum-one-mainnet/keystore`.

> **Note:** It is paramount that you securely manage the private key, as it
> controls your wallet and funds.

- Use both the `-orchestrator` and `-transcoder` flags to run the binary in
  orchestrator mode transcoding video.

- `-nvidia` is used to specify a comma delimited string of Nvidia GPU IDs. The
  flag is only required when transcoding with Nvidia GPUs
- `-pricePerUnit` is used to specify the price (wei per pixel) for transcoding.
  The flag is required on startup, but the value can be changed later.
- `-serviceAddr` is used to specify the publicly accessible address that the
  orchestrator should receive requests at. Changing this requires a blockchain
  transaction, so it's preferable to use a hostname for a domain you own, not an
  IP address that may change.
