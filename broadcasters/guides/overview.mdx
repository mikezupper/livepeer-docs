## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you are familiar with installing software on unix-based
systems. You should be comfortable with command-line syntax, Networking,
Firewalls, and containerized environments. You should have a basic understanding
of the Livepeer protocol. You dont have to be an expert, but troubleshooting
skills will come in handy.

This guide was developed using:

- Ubuntu Linux 22.04
- Docker 20.10.14
- Livepeer 0.7.1
- root user access (sudo is ok)

Have access to an Arbitrum RPC URL. This is required to run Livepeer. You can
use any RPC URL, some of the commonly used services are
[Infura](https://www.infura.io/) and [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).
