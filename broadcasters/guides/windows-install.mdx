```
Create a bat file to launch Livepeer.  Use the following as a template, adding your personal info and save a .bat file in the same directory as the Livepeer executable.

```
livepeer.exe -network arbitrum-one-mainnet -ethUrl=<YOUR ARB RPC> -serviceAddr=<YOUR BROADCASTER PUBLIC IP ADDRESS>:8935 -broadcaster -ethPassword=<YOUR PASSWORD>-maxPricePerUnit=300 -monitor -v=6-rtmpAddr=0.0.0.0:1935 -httpAddr=0.0.0.0:8935 -blockPollingInterval 20 

PAUSE
```
If you'd like the Broadcaster to start with Windows you can create a System service using [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/) or the Windows Task Scheduler.

Open the Livepeer CLI, then Jump to [Configure the Livepeer Broadcaster](/broadcasters/guides/configure-broadcaster) to finish configuring the Broadcaster
```
livepeer_cli.exe
