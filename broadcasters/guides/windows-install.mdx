## Download and unzip the Livepeer binary

```
https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases/download/<RELEASE_VERSION>/livepeer-windows-amd64.zip

```
## Create a bat file to launch Livepeer.  

Use the following as a template, adding your personal info and save a .bat file in the same directory as the Livepeer executable.

```
-livepeer.exe ^
-network arbitrum-one-mainnet ^ 
-ethUrl=<YOUR ARB RPC> ^
-serviceAddr=<YOUR BROADCASTER PUBLIC IP ADDRESS>:8935 ^ 
-broadcaster ^
-ethPassword=C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\.lpData\ethsecret.txt ^
-maxPricePerUnit=300 ^
-pricePerUnit=1 ^
-monitor ^ 
-v=6 ^
-rtmpAddr=0.0.0.0:1935 ^ 
-httpAddr=0.0.0.0:8935 ^
-blockPollingInterval=20 ^


PAUSE
```
## Create a file containing your Broadcaster Ethereum password

**This password is used to decrypt the keystore file and access the private key. Make sure to never share or lose access to either the password or the keystore file**

In `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\.lpData` create a txt file named `ethsecret.txt` with the password

*If you'd like the Broadcaster to start with Windows you can create a System service using [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/) or the Windows Task Scheduler.*

Open the Livepeer CLI, then Jump to [Configure Transcoding Options](/broadcasters/guides/transcoding-options) to finish configuring the Broadcaster
```
livepeer_cli.exe
