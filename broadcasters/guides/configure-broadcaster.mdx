# Bridge ETH to Arbitrum

In order to use the Broadcaster you need to send ETH to your Broadcaster address. **Note that Livepeer uses the Arbitrium network so you must first bridge ETH to Arbitrum from Ethereum mainnet if you do not already have ETH on Arbitrum.**

If you need to bridge ETH you can use the official bridge https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ or use an exchange that supports L2 transfers.

Once you have ETH on the Arbitrum network, transfer it to your newly created Broadcaster address.

If not already in the Livepeer CLI, open it following the instructions above for your platform.

# Fund Broadcaster
We now need to divide the Broacaster funds into a **Deposit** and **Reserve**

Choose **Option 11. Invoke "deposit broadcasting funds" (ETH)**

*In this guide we are using a total of 0.1 ETH.*

Enter 0.075 for the Deposit and 0.025 for the Reserve amounts when prompted.

Choose **Option 1. Get node status** and confirm that the correct amounts are visible in the **BROADCASTER STATS** section.

# Set Price and Default Transcoding Files 
We will now use **Option 15. Set broadcast config** to enter the price we will pay for transcoding and choose the transcoding profiles

*Below is an example.  You can modify the values to suit your needs.*
```
Enter a maximum transcoding price per pixel, in wei per pixels (pricePerUnit / pixelsPerUnit).
eg. 1 wei / 10 pixels = 0,1 wei per pixel

Enter amount of pixels that make up a single unit (default: 1 pixel) - > 1

Enter the maximum price to pay for 1 pixels in Wei (required) - > 300
