# Bridge ETH to Arbitrum

In order to use the Broadcaster you need to send ETH to your Broadcaster address. **Note that Livepeer uses the Arbitrium network so you must first bridge ETH to Arbitrum from Ethereum mainnet if you do not already have ETH on Arbitrum.**

If you need to bridge ETH you can use the official bridge https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ or use an exchange that supports L2 transfers.

Once you have ETH on the Arbitrum network, transfer it to your newly created Broadcaster address.

If not already in the Livepeer CLI, open it following the instructions above for your platform.

# Fund Broadcaster
We now need to divide the Broacaster funds into a **Deposit** and **Reserve**

Choose **Option 11. Invoke "deposit broadcasting funds" (ETH)**

*In this guide we are using a total of 0.1 ETH.  This is minimum recommended and best suited for testing.*

Enter 0.07 for the Deposit and 0.03 for the Reserve amounts when prompted.

To calculate the ticket price your Broadcaster will pay divide the Reserve amount by 100.  In our example each payment will be 0.0003 ETH (0.03 / 100)

As you pay tickets for transcoding the ticket amount paid is subtracted from your deposit amount, so make sure to monitor your deposit balance and top it off to keep your Broadcaster transcoding.

Choose **Option 1. Get node status** and confirm that the correct amounts are visible in the **BROADCASTER STATS** section.

# Set Price and Default Transcoding Files 
We will now use **Option 15. Set broadcast config** to enter the price we will pay for transcoding and choose the transcoding profiles

*Below is an example.  You can modify the values to suit your needs.*
```
Enter a maximum transcoding price per pixel, in wei per pixels (pricePerUnit / pixelsPerUnit).
eg. 1 wei / 10 pixels = 0,1 wei per pixel

Enter amount of pixels that make up a single unit (default: 1 pixel) - > 1

Enter the maximum price to pay for 1 pixels in Wei (required) - > 300

Identifier      Transcoding Options

9               P720p25fps16x9
10              P720p30fps16x9
11              P720p30fps4x3
12              P720p60fps16x9

Enter the identifiers of the video profiles you would like to use (use a comma as the delimiter in a list of identifiers) - > 5,8,10
```
To better control your encoding profiles it is recommended to use a json file to specify the resolution and bitrate for your encoding ladder.

Use the following as a template for your json file
```
[
{
  "name": "480p0",
  "fps": 0,
  "bitrate": 1600000,
  "width": 854,
  "height": 480,
  "profile": "h264constrainedhigh",
  "gop": "1"
},
{
  "name": "720p0",
  "fps": 0,
  "bitrate": 3000000,
  "width": 1280,
  "height": 720,
  "profile": "h264constrainedhigh",
  "gop": "1"
},
{
  "name": "1080p0",

  "width": 1920,
  "height": 1080,
  "profile": "h264constrainedhigh",
  "gop": "1"
}
]
```
Save the transcodingOptions.json file in the .lpData directory
